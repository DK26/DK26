# 🛡️ Security Platform Engineer | Rust & Python

I build **security-by-design platforms and developer tools**: safe primitives, guardrails, and reliable services that help teams ship faster without shipping incidents.

My work blends **backend engineering**, **security engineering**, and **systems design** — with open-source Rust projects focused on correctness and hard-to-misuse APIs.

---

## 💡 Focus
- Security tooling & platforms (safe-by-default libraries, policy layers, automation)
- Backend systems (performance, reliability, clean APIs)
- SIEM/SOC automation & pipelines
- Currently expanding: Kubernetes + observability + MCP servers

## 🔎 Where to start
Check the pinned repos for my core Rust security primitives and platform/tooling work.

---

## 🧭 Principles
- Make powerful things feel simple
- Explicit boundaries, small trusted cores
- Clarity, maintainability, real-world impact

---

## 🧠 Journey
- Started coding early (DOS/Pascal), later built small GUI tools (VB6)
- Built a strong networking/IT foundation and moved into SIEM/SOC environments
- Shipped and maintained automation + backend systems in Python over multiple years
- Shifted toward Rust to build security-by-design primitives and developer tooling
- Today: security tooling/platforms + SIEM automation, expanding cloud-native fundamentals
