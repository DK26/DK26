# 👋 Hi there, I'm Dave.

I'm a Backend Engineer with a strong focus on performance, system design, and secure architecture — building reliable tools and services with **Rust** and **Python**.

With over 9 years of experience in backend development and security automation, I've worked across finance and health-tech sectors, tackling complex backend problems involving:

- 🧰 **Microservice migrations** (Java → Rust)
- ⚙️ **Scalable system design** & performance troubleshooting
- 🛡️ **Security-focused automation** (SIEM/SOC integrations)
- 📊 **Observability** and log ingestion tooling
- 🔌 **API integrations** and developer tooling

---

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- Building backend systems that are secure, scalable, and developer-friendly  
- Improving existing open-source projects and exploring new ones in the **Rust ecosystem**  
- Learning about **FastAPI**, **Kubernetes**, and **distributed system patterns**

Thanks for stopping by!  
Always open to collaboration, code reviews, and conversations about backend systems, Rust, or security tooling.
