# 🛠️ Backend Engineer | Rust & Python Enthusiast  

I’m a self-taught engineer with roots going back to DOS and Pascal, and a passion for building practical, high-performance backend systems that solve real-world problems.

These days, I focus on designing secure, efficient, and developer-friendly software — blending high-level design with low-level control.

## 💡 My Philosophy  
- **Make powerful things feel simple**  
- **Bridge high-level productivity and low-level performance**  
- **Prioritize clarity, maintainability, and real-world impact**

## 🧠 My Journey  
- Built my first DOS quiz game at 12 using Pascal  
- Created GUI tools in VB6 to launch LAN game servers  
- Learned networking, worked in IT & SIEM/SOC environments  
- Spent years building automations and tools in Python  
- Discovered Rust and fell in love with its safety and performance  
- Now designing APIs and systems with Rust that are simple to use, hard to misuse
